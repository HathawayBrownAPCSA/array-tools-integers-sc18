Hi Sara,

A good solution to this question - to do it using only one loop.
Very effective code.

A couple of design questions, though.
You have private instance variables max, min, and the array minMax.  
You store the maximum and minimum values in two places.
These are redundant.  You should either store the maximum value in max or in minMax[0], but not both.
Having the same value in two places is asking for trouble - if someone modifies the code, they would
  be likely to change one but not the other.

Fully functional, however, and very efficient to loop only once to get all four values!

** Update Feb. 1
I still can't see the StringArrayTools.  Would you please commit them to master?

Thanks,

** Update Feb. 20
StringArrayTools posted Feb 13.  All functional.  Mixed in Shakespeare for good measure - 
a nice way to then be able to use fillRandom() :-)

Credit for the owrk; not full credit because it was not timely.
